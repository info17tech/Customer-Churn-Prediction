# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for customer churn in a telecommunications company using a dataset of 3,333 entries and 20 relevant features, which primarily include customer behavior metrics like call patterns and service usage. The solution involves a comprehensive approach encompassing data cleaning (removing duplicates and irrelevant columns), exploratory data analysis (EDA) for visual insights into customer behavior, feature engineering to transform non-normally distributed variables, and implementing various machine learning algorithms, with a focus on balancing the churn class distribution. The process culminates with the selection of the best-performing model, LightGBM, through hyperparameter tuning, ultimately enabling the company to predict and address potential churn, thereby enhancing customer retention strategies.
